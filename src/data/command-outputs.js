  bio: `
        Since my first encounter with a computer in 1998, I’ve been passionate about technology. The creative freedom invoked my love of programming and over the past decade of my career in the software development industry has helped me help dozens of businesses produce online solutions, as well as growing teams develop softwares as services.
        <br /><br />
        In 2010 I took my first position with Imagine Marketing, where I remotely developed and managed online stores. Then in 2012 I started helping the Wysong team create interactive JavaScript applications. When I moved to Salt Lake City in 2015 I worked with Diib on a predictive analytics service before I took a remote position with WaveOrtho for two years writing software components and PHP FileMaker Server APIs. In 2017, Deseret News offered me a position developing interactives for articles and a CRUD dashboard to manage almanac content.
        <br /><br />
        Since then I’ve worked with dozens of local and international businesses to produce professional marketing materials and sophisticated web based technologies. I’ve saved my clients countless hours by programming automation scripts, increased workspace productivity by developing Chrome Extensions, and helped create secure dashboards with tools to manage large realtime databases holding encrypted information.
        <br /><br />
        Please have a look at my resume to learn more about the type of work that I’ve done. I am pleased to have worked with all of these wonderful professionals and will offer the same level of dedication for your project as well.
